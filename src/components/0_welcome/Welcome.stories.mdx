# Oreus's UI Library

This isolated components library was built by Oreus to be used in various web application projects.
In this page, we'll help you get started with the library.

## Installation

The UI library is available as an NPM package, so the installation is pretty simple.
Simply run the following command;

`npm install @oreus/ui`

To use your first component, simply import it from the package as such;

```javascript
import Button from '@oreus/ui';

function App() {
    return <Button onClick={() => console.log('Button clicked !')}>Click me !</Button>
}
```

Which should result in;

<Canvas>
  {/* <Button onClick={() => console.log('Button clicked !')}>Click me !</Button> */}
</Canvas>

## Roadmap

We're targetting the end of January for an initial release of the UI library. That 1.0.0 version
will include all components, but no test. The following weeks will be dedicated to testing every
component.

After that, components will be added as they are needed in our projects or per other contributions.
